C This is the 12 November 2003 version of
C DLSODA: Livermore Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations, with
C         Automatic method switching for stiff and nonstiff problems.
C
C This version is in double precision.
C
C DLSODA solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
C systems of first order ODEs,
C     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form,
C     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(NEQ)) (i = 1,...,NEQ).
C
C This a variant version of the DLSODE package.
C It switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff methods.
C This means that the user does not have to determine whether the
C problem is stiff or not, and the solver will automatically choose the
C appropriate method.  It always starts with the nonstiff method.

C Summary of Usage.
C
C Communication between the user and the DLSODA package, for normal
C situations, is summarized here.  This summary describes only a subset
C of the full set of options available.  See the full description for
C details, including alternative treatment of the Jacobian matrix,
C optional inputs and outputs, nonstandard options, and
C instructions for special situations.  See also the example
C problem (with program and output) following this summary.
C
C A. First provide a subroutine of the form:
C               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C which supplies the vector function f by loading YDOT(i) with f(i).
C
C B. Write a main program which calls Subroutine DLSODA once for
C each point at which answers are desired.  This should also provide
C for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
C by DLSODA.  On the first call to DLSODA, supply arguments as follows:
C F      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
C          This name must be declared External in calling program.
C NEQ    = number of first order ODEs.
C Y      = array of initial values, of length NEQ.
C T      = the initial value of the independent variable.
C TOUT   = first point where output is desired (.ne. T).
C ITOL   = 1 or 2 according as ATOL (below) is a scalar or array.
C RTOL   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
C ATOL   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
C          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
C          to be less than
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL     if ITOL = 1, or
C             EWT(i) = RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)  if ITOL = 2.
C          Thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
C          either the absolute error is less than ATOL (or ATOL(i)),
C          or the relative error is less than RTOL.
C          Use RTOL = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
C          use ATOL = 0.0 (or ATOL(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
C          control.  Caution: actual (global) errors may exceed these
C          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
C ITASK  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = TOUT.
C ISTATE = integer flag (input and output).  Set ISTATE = 1.
C IOPT   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
C RWORK  = real work array of length at least:
C             22 + NEQ * MAX(16, NEQ + 9).
C          See also Paragraph E below.
C LRW    = declared length of RWORK (in user's dimension).
C IWORK  = integer work array of length at least  20 + NEQ.
C LIW    = declared length of IWORK (in user's dimension).
C JAC    = name of subroutine for Jacobian matrix.
C          Use a dummy name.  See also Paragraph E below.
C JT     = Jacobian type indicator.  Set JT = 2.
C          See also Paragraph E below.
C Note that the main program must declare arrays Y, RWORK, IWORK,
C and possibly ATOL.
C
C C. The output from the first call (or any call) is:
C      Y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
C      T = corresponding value of independent variable (normally TOUT).
C ISTATE = 2  if DLSODA was successful, negative otherwise.
C          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong JT).
C          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
C          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
C          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
C          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad Jacobian
C             supplied or wrong choice of JT or tolerances).
C          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (Solution
C             component i vanished, and ATOL or ATOL(i) = 0.)
C          -7 means work space insufficient to finish (see messages).
C
C D. To continue the integration after a successful return, simply
C reset TOUT and call DLSODA again.  No other parameters need be reset.
C
C E. Note: If and when DLSODA regards the problem as stiff, and
C switches methods accordingly, it must make use of the NEQ by NEQ
C Jacobian matrix, J = df/dy.  For the sake of simplicity, the
C inputs to DLSODA recommended in Paragraph B above cause DLSODA to
C treat J as a full matrix, and to approximate it internally by
C difference quotients.  Alternatively, J can be treated as a band
C matrix (with great potential reduction in the size of the RWORK
C array).  Also, in either the full or banded case, the user can supply
C J in closed form, with a routine whose name is passed as the JAC
C argument.  These alternatives are described in the paragraphs on
C RWORK, JAC, and JT in the full description of the call sequence below.

C Example Problem.
C
C The following is a simple example problem, with the coding
C needed for its solution by DLSODA.  The problem is from chemical
C kinetics, and consists of the following three rate equations:
C     dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3
C     dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2
C     dy3/dt = 3.e7*y2**2
C on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions
C y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0.  The problem is stiff.
C
C The following coding solves this problem with DLSODA,
C printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.e10.  It uses
C ITOL = 2 and ATOL much smaller for y2 than y1 or y3 because
C y2 has much smaller values.
C At the end of the run, statistical quantities of interest are
C printed (see optional outputs in the full description below).

C Full description of user interface to DLSODA.
C
C The user interface to DLSODA consists of the following parts.
C
C 1.   The call sequence to Subroutine DLSODA, which is a driver
C      routine for the solver.  This includes descriptions of both
C      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
C      following these descriptions is a description of
C      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
C      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
C
C 2.   Descriptions of other routines in the DLSODA package that may be
C      (optionally) called by the user.  These provide the ability to
C      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
C      Common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
C
C 3.   Descriptions of Common blocks to be declared in overlay
C      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
C      of the problem and continued solution later.
C
C 4.   Description of a subroutine in the DLSODA package,
C      which the user may replace with his/her own version, if desired.
C      this relates to the measurement of errors.
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 1.  Call Sequence.
C
C The call sequence parameters used for input only are
C     F, NEQ, TOUT, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, ITASK, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JAC, JT,
C and those used for both input and output are
C     Y, T, ISTATE.
C The work arrays RWORK and IWORK are also used for conditional and
C optional inputs and optional outputs.  (The term output here refers
C to the return from Subroutine DLSODA to the user's calling program.)
C
C The legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
C initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
C change in input parameters is flagged by ISTATE = 3 on input.
C
C The descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
C
C F      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
C          ODE system.  The system must be put in the first-order
C          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
C          of the scalar t and the vector y.  Subroutine F is to
C          compute the function f.  It is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE F (NEQ, T, Y, YDOT)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), YDOT(*)
C          where NEQ, T, and Y are input, and the array YDOT = f(t,y)
C          is output.  Y and YDOT are arrays of length NEQ.
C          Subroutine F should not alter Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).
C          F must be declared External in the calling program.
C
C          Subroutine F may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in F) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y below.
C
C          If quantities computed in the F routine are needed
C          externally to DLSODA, an extra call to F should be made
C          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
C          If only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use DINTDY instead.
C
C NEQ    = the size of the ODE system (number of first order
C          ordinary differential equations).  Used only for input.
C          NEQ may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
C          If NEQ is decreased (with ISTATE = 3 on input), the
C          remaining components of Y should be left undisturbed, if
C          these are to be accessed in F and/or JAC.
C
C          Normally, NEQ is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
C          as a scalar in this user interface description.  However,
C          NEQ may be an array, with NEQ(1) set to the system size.
C          (The DLSODA package accesses only NEQ(1).)  In either case,
C          this parameter is passed as the NEQ argument in all calls
C          to F and JAC.  Hence, if it is an array, locations
C          NEQ(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass
C          it to F and/or JAC.  Subroutines F and/or JAC must include
C          NEQ in a Dimension statement in that case.
C
C Y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
C          length NEQ or more.  Used for both input and output on the
C          first call (ISTATE = 1), and only for output on other calls.
C          On the first call, Y must contain the vector of initial
C          values.  On output, Y contains the computed solution vector,
C          evaluated at T.  If desired, the Y array may be used
C          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
C
C          This array is passed as the Y argument in all calls to
C          F and JAC.  Hence its length may exceed NEQ, and locations
C          Y(NEQ+1),... may be used to store other real data and
C          pass it to F and/or JAC.  (The DLSODA package accesses only
C          Y(1),...,Y(NEQ).)
C
C T      = the independent variable.  On input, T is used only on the
C          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
C          on output, after each call, T is the value at which a
C          computed solution Y is evaluated (usually the same as TOUT).
C          on an error return, T is the farthest point reached.
C
C TOUT   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
C          Used only for input.
C
C          When starting the problem (ISTATE = 1), TOUT may be equal
C          to T for one call, then should .ne. T for the next call.
C          For the initial t, an input value of TOUT .ne. T is used
C          in order to determine the direction of the integration
C          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
C          scale of the problem.  Integration in either direction
C          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
C
C          If ITASK = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), TOUT is ignored after
C          the first call (i.e. the first call with TOUT .ne. T).
C          Otherwise, TOUT is required on every call.
C
C          If ITASK = 1, 3, or 4, the values of TOUT need not be
C          monotone, but a value of TOUT which backs up is limited
C          to the current internal T interval, whose endpoints are
C          TCUR - HU and TCUR (see optional outputs, below, for
C          TCUR and HU).
C
C ITOL   = an indicator for the type of error control.  See
C          description below under ATOL.  Used only for input.
C
C RTOL   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  See description below under ATOL.
C          Input only.
C
C ATOL   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
C          an array of length NEQ.  Input only.
C
C             The input parameters ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL determine
C          the error control performed by the solver.  The solver will
C          control the vector E = (E(i)) of estimated local errors
C          in y, according to an inequality of the form
C                      max-norm of ( E(i)/EWT(i) )   .le.   1,
C          where EWT = (EWT(i)) is a vector of positive error weights.
C          The values of RTOL and ATOL should all be non-negative.
C          The following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
C          RTOL and ATOL, and the corresponding form of EWT(i).
C
C             ITOL    RTOL       ATOL          EWT(i)
C              1     scalar     scalar     RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              2     scalar     array      RTOL*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C              3     array      scalar     RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL
C              4     array      array      RTOL(i)*ABS(Y(i)) + ATOL(i)
C
C          When either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
C          be dimensioned in the user's calling program.
C
C          If none of the above choices (with ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL
C          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
C          error controls can be obtained by substituting a
C          user-supplied routine for the setting of EWT.
C          See Part 4 below.
C
C          If global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
C          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
C          components of RTOL and ATOL (i.e. of EWT) should be scaled
C          down uniformly.
C
C ITASK  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
C          Input only.  ITASK has the following values and meanings.
C          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT (by overshooting and interpolating).
C          2  means take one step only and return.
C          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
C             beyond t = TOUT and return.
C          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
C             t = TOUT but without overshooting t = TCRIT.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).  TCRIT may be equal to
C             or beyond TOUT, but not behind it in the direction of
C             integration.  This option is useful if the problem
C             has a singularity at or beyond t = TCRIT.
C          5  means take one step, without passing TCRIT, and return.
C             TCRIT must be input as RWORK(1).
C
C          Note:  If ITASK = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches TCRIT
C          (within roundoff), it will return T = TCRIT (exactly) to
C          indicate this (unless ITASK = 4 and TOUT comes before TCRIT,
C          in which case answers at t = TOUT are returned first).
C
C ISTATE = an index used for input and output to specify the
C          the state of the calculation.
C
C          On input, the values of ISTATE are as follows.
C          1  means this is the first call for the problem
C             (initializations will be done).  See note below.
C          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
C             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
C             parameters except possibly TOUT and ITASK.
C             (If ITOL, RTOL, and/or ATOL are changed between calls
C             with ISTATE = 2, the new values will be used but not
C             tested for legality.)
C          3  means this is not the first call, and the
C             calculation is to continue normally, but with
C             a change in input parameters other than
C             TOUT and ITASK.  Changes are allowed in
C             NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, IOPT, LRW, LIW, JT, ML, MU,
C             and any optional inputs except H0, MXORDN, and MXORDS.
C             (See IWORK description for ML and MU.)
C          Note:  A preliminary call with TOUT = T is not counted
C          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
C          input is done.  (Such a call is sometimes useful for the
C          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
C          Thus the first call for which TOUT .ne. T requires
C          ISTATE = 1 on input.
C
C          On output, ISTATE has the following values and meanings.
C           1  means nothing was done; TOUT = T and ISTATE = 1 on input.
C           2  means the integration was performed successfully.
C          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than MXSTEP
C              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
C              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
C              successful as far as T.  (MXSTEP is an optional input
C              and is normally 500.)  To continue, the user may
C              simply reset ISTATE to a value .gt. 1 and call again
C              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
C              In addition, the user may increase MXSTEP to avoid
C              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
C          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
C              of the machine being used.  This was detected before
C              completing the requested task, but the integration
C              was successful as far as T.  To continue, the tolerance
C              parameters must be reset, and ISTATE must be set
C              to 3.  The optional output TOLSF may be used for this
C              purpose.  (Note: If this condition is detected before
C              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
C              (ISTATE = -3) occurs instead.)
C          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
C              integration steps.  See written message for details.
C              Note:  If the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
C              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
C              the run to stop.
C          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              The problem may have a singularity, or the input
C              may be inappropriate.
C          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
C              one attempted step, before completing the requested
C              task, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              This may be caused by an inaccurate Jacobian matrix,
C              if one is being used.
C          -6  means EWT(i) became zero for some i during the
C              integration.  Pure relative error control (ATOL(i)=0.0)
C              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
C              The integration was successful as far as T.
C          -7  means the length of RWORK and/or IWORK was too small to
C              proceed, but the integration was successful as far as T.
C              This happens when DLSODA chooses to switch methods
C              but LRW and/or LIW is too small for the new method.
C
C          Note:  Since the normal output value of ISTATE is 2,
C          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
C          Also, since a negative input value of ISTATE will be
C          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
C          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
C          calling the solver again.
C
C IOPT   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
C          inputs are being used on this call.  Input only.
C          The optional inputs are listed separately below.
C          IOPT = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
C                   default values will be used in all cases.
C          IOPT = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
C
C RWORK  = a real array (double precision) for work space, and (in the
C          first 20 words) for conditional and optional inputs and
C          optional outputs.
C          As DLSODA switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff
C          methods, the required length of RWORK can change during the
C          problem.  Thus the RWORK array passed to DLSODA can either
C          have a static (fixed) length large enough for both methods,
C          or have a dynamic (changing) length altered by the calling
C          program in response to output from DLSODA.
C
C                       --- Fixed Length Case ---
C          If the RWORK length is to be fixed, it should be at least
C               MAX (LRN, LRS),
C          where LRN and LRS are the RWORK lengths required when the
C          current method is nonstiff or stiff, respectively.
C
C          The separate RWORK length requirements LRN and LRS are
C          as follows:
C          IF NEQ is constant and the maximum method orders have
C          their default values, then
C             LRN = 20 + 16*NEQ,
C             LRS = 22 + 9*NEQ + NEQ**2           if JT = 1 or 2,
C             LRS = 22 + 10*NEQ + (2*ML+MU)*NEQ   if JT = 4 or 5.
C          Under any other conditions, LRN and LRS are given by:
C             LRN = 20 + NYH*(MXORDN+1) + 3*NEQ,
C             LRS = 20 + NYH*(MXORDS+1) + 3*NEQ + LMAT,
C          where
C             NYH    = the initial value of NEQ,
C             MXORDN = 12, unless a smaller value is given as an
C                      optional input,
C             MXORDS = 5, unless a smaller value is given as an
C                      optional input,
C             LMAT   = length of matrix work space:
C             LMAT   = NEQ**2 + 2              if JT = 1 or 2,
C             LMAT   = (2*ML + MU + 1)*NEQ + 2 if JT = 4 or 5.
C
C                       --- Dynamic Length Case ---
C          If the length of RWORK is to be dynamic, then it should
C          be at least LRN or LRS, as defined above, depending on the
C          current method.  Initially, it must be at least LRN (since
C          DLSODA starts with the nonstiff method).  On any return
C          from DLSODA, the optional output MCUR indicates the current
C          method.  If MCUR differs from the value it had on the
C          previous return, or if there has only been one call to
C          DLSODA and MCUR is now 2, then DLSODA has switched
C          methods during the last call, and the length of RWORK
C          should be reset (to LRN if MCUR = 1, or to LRS if
C          MCUR = 2).  (An increase in the RWORK length is required
C          if DLSODA returned ISTATE = -7, but not otherwise.)
C          After resetting the length, call DLSODA with ISTATE = 3
C          to signal that change.
C
C LRW    = the length of the array RWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C IWORK  = an integer array for work space.
C          As DLSODA switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff
C          methods, the required length of IWORK can change during
C          problem, between
C             LIS = 20 + NEQ   and   LIN = 20,
C          respectively.  Thus the IWORK array passed to DLSODA can
C          either have a fixed length of at least 20 + NEQ, or have a
C          dynamic length of at least LIN or LIS, depending on the
C          current method.  The comments on dynamic length under
C          RWORK above apply here.  Initially, this length need
C          only be at least LIN = 20.
C
C          The first few words of IWORK are used for conditional and
C          optional inputs and optional outputs.
C
C          The following 2 words in IWORK are conditional inputs:
C            IWORK(1) = ML     these are the lower and upper
C            IWORK(2) = MU     half-bandwidths, respectively, of the
C                       banded Jacobian, excluding the main diagonal.
C                       The band is defined by the matrix locations
C                       (i,j) with i-ML .le. j .le. i+MU.  ML and MU
C                       must satisfy  0 .le.  ML,MU  .le. NEQ-1.
C                       These are required if JT is 4 or 5, and
C                       ignored otherwise.  ML and MU may in fact be
C                       the band parameters for a matrix to which
C                       df/dy is only approximately equal.
C
C LIW    = the length of the array IWORK, as declared by the user.
C          (This will be checked by the solver.)
C
C Note: The base addresses of the work arrays must not be
C altered between calls to DLSODA for the same problem.
C The contents of the work arrays must not be altered
C between calls, except possibly for the conditional and
C optional inputs, and except for the last 3*NEQ words of RWORK.
C The latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
C available for use by the user outside DLSODA between calls, if
C desired (but not for use by F or JAC).
C
C JAC    = the name of the user-supplied routine to compute the
C          Jacobian matrix, df/dy, if JT = 1 or 4.  The JAC routine
C          is optional, but if the problem is expected to be stiff much
C          of the time, you are encouraged to supply JAC, for the sake
C          of efficiency.  (Alternatively, set JT = 2 or 5 to have
C          DLSODA compute df/dy internally by difference quotients.)
C          If and when DLSODA uses df/dy, it treats this NEQ by NEQ
C          matrix either as full (JT = 1 or 2), or as banded (JT =
C          4 or 5) with half-bandwidths ML and MU (discussed under
C          IWORK above).  In either case, if JT = 1 or 4, the JAC
C          routine must compute df/dy as a function of the scalar t
C          and the vector y.  It is to have the form
C               SUBROUTINE JAC (NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, PD, NROWPD)
C               DOUBLE PRECISION T, Y(*), PD(NROWPD,*)
C          where NEQ, T, Y, ML, MU, and NROWPD are input and the array
C          PD is to be loaded with partial derivatives (elements of
C          the Jacobian matrix) on output.  PD must be given a first
C          dimension of NROWPD.  T and Y have the same meaning as in
C          Subroutine F.
C               In the full matrix case (JT = 1), ML and MU are
C          ignored, and the Jacobian is to be loaded into PD in
C          columnwise manner, with df(i)/dy(j) loaded into PD(i,j).
C               In the band matrix case (JT = 4), the elements
C          within the band are to be loaded into PD in columnwise
C          manner, with diagonal lines of df/dy loaded into the rows
C          of PD.  Thus df(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded into PD(i-j+MU+1,j).
C          ML and MU are the half-bandwidth parameters (see IWORK).
C          The locations in PD in the two triangular areas which
C          correspond to nonexistent matrix elements can be ignored
C          or loaded arbitrarily, as they are overwritten by DLSODA.
C               JAC need not provide df/dy exactly.  A crude
C          approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
C               In either case, PD is preset to zero by the solver,
C          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by JAC.
C          Each call to JAC is preceded by a call to F with the same
C          arguments NEQ, T, and Y.  Thus to gain some efficiency,
C          intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
C          saved in a user Common block by F and not recomputed by JAC,
C          if desired.  Also, JAC may alter the Y array, if desired.
C          JAC must be declared External in the calling program.
C               Subroutine JAC may access user-defined quantities in
C          NEQ(2),... and/or in Y(NEQ(1)+1),... if NEQ is an array
C          (dimensioned in JAC) and/or Y has length exceeding NEQ(1).
C          See the descriptions of NEQ and Y above.
C
C JT     = Jacobian type indicator.  Used only for input.
C          JT specifies how the Jacobian matrix df/dy will be
C          treated, if and when DLSODA requires this matrix.
C          JT has the following values and meanings:
C           1 means a user-supplied full (NEQ by NEQ) Jacobian.
C           2 means an internally generated (difference quotient) full
C             Jacobian (using NEQ extra calls to F per df/dy value).
C           4 means a user-supplied banded Jacobian.
C           5 means an internally generated banded Jacobian (using
C             ML+MU+1 extra calls to F per df/dy evaluation).
C          If JT = 1 or 4, the user must supply a Subroutine JAC
C          (the name is arbitrary) as described above under JAC.
C          If JT = 2 or 5, a dummy argument can be used.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Inputs.
C
C The following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
C call sequence.  (See also Part 2.)  For each such input variable,
C this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
C location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
C The use of any of these inputs requires IOPT = 1, and in that
C case all of these inputs are examined.  A value of zero for any
C of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
C Thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
C locations 5 to 10 in RWORK and IWORK to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
C then set those of interest to nonzero values.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning and Default Value
C
C H0      RWORK(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
C                   The default value is determined by the solver.
C
C HMAX    RWORK(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is infinite.
C
C HMIN    RWORK(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
C                   The default value is 0.  (This lower bound is not
C                   enforced on the final step before reaching TCRIT
C                   when ITASK = 4 or 5.)
C
C IXPR    IWORK(5)  flag to generate extra printing at method switches.
C                   IXPR = 0 means no extra printing (the default).
C                   IXPR = 1 means print data on each switch.
C                   T, H, and NST will be printed on the same logical
C                   unit as used for error messages.
C
C MXSTEP  IWORK(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
C                   allowed during one call to the solver.
C                   The default value is 500.
C
C MXHNIL  IWORK(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
C                   warning that T + H = T on a step (H = step size).
C                   This must be positive to result in a non-default
C                   value.  The default value is 10.
C
C MXORDN  IWORK(8)  the maximum order to be allowed for the nonstiff
C                   (Adams) method.  the default value is 12.
C                   if MXORDN exceeds the default value, it will
C                   be reduced to the default value.
C                   MXORDN is held constant during the problem.
C
C MXORDS  IWORK(9)  the maximum order to be allowed for the stiff
C                   (BDF) method.  The default value is 5.
C                   If MXORDS exceeds the default value, it will
C                   be reduced to the default value.
C                   MXORDS is held constant during the problem.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Optional Outputs.
C
C As optional additional output from DLSODA, the variables listed
C below are quantities related to the performance of DLSODA
C which are available to the user.  These are communicated by way of
C the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
C except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
C on any successful return from DLSODA, and on any return with
C ISTATE = -1, -2, -4, -5, or -6.  On an illegal input return
C (ISTATE = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values
C (if any), except possibly for TOLSF, LENRW, and LENIW.
C On any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
C as noted below.
C
C Name    Location      Meaning
C
C HU      RWORK(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
C
C HCUR    RWORK(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
C
C TCUR    RWORK(13) the current value of the independent variable
C                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
C                   current internal mesh point in t.  On output, TCUR
C                   will always be at least as far as the argument
C                   T, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
C
C TOLSF   RWORK(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
C                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
C                   detected (ISTATE = -3 if detected at the start of
C                   the problem, ISTATE = -2 otherwise).  If ITOL is
C                   left unaltered but RTOL and ATOL are uniformly
C                   scaled up by a factor of TOLSF for the next call,
C                   then the solver is deemed likely to succeed.
C                   (The user may also ignore TOLSF and alter the
C                   tolerance parameters in any other way appropriate.)
C
C TSW     RWORK(15) the value of t at the time of the last method
C                   switch, if any.
C
C NST     IWORK(11) the number of steps taken for the problem so far.
C
C NFE     IWORK(12) the number of f evaluations for the problem so far.
C
C NJE     IWORK(13) the number of Jacobian evaluations (and of matrix
C                   LU decompositions) for the problem so far.
C
C NQU     IWORK(14) the method order last used (successfully).
C
C NQCUR   IWORK(15) the order to be attempted on the next step.
C
C IMXER   IWORK(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
C                   the weighted local error vector ( E(i)/EWT(i) ),
C                   on an error return with ISTATE = -4 or -5.
C
C LENRW   IWORK(17) the length of RWORK actually required, assuming
C                   that the length of RWORK is to be fixed for the
C                   rest of the problem, and that switching may occur.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C LENIW   IWORK(18) the length of IWORK actually required, assuming
C                   that the length of IWORK is to be fixed for the
C                   rest of the problem, and that switching may occur.
C                   This is defined on normal returns and on an illegal
C                   input return for insufficient storage.
C
C MUSED   IWORK(19) the method indicator for the last successful step:
C                   1 means Adams (nonstiff), 2 means BDF (stiff).
C
C MCUR    IWORK(20) the current method indicator:
C                   1 means Adams (nonstiff), 2 means BDF (stiff).
C                   This is the method to be attempted
C                   on the next step.  Thus it differs from MUSED
C                   only if a method switch has just been made.
C
C The following two arrays are segments of the RWORK array which
C may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
C For each array, the table below gives its internal name,
C its base address in RWORK, and its description.
C
C Name    Base Address      Description
C
C YH      21             the Nordsieck history array, of size NYH by
C                        (NQCUR + 1), where NYH is the initial value
C                        of NEQ.  For j = 0,1,...,NQCUR, column j+1
C                        of YH contains HCUR**j/factorial(j) times
C                        the j-th derivative of the interpolating
C                        polynomial currently representing the solution,
C                        evaluated at T = TCUR.
C
C ACOR     LACOR         array of size NEQ used for the accumulated
C         (from Common   corrections on each step, scaled on output
C           as noted)    to represent the estimated local error in y
C                        on the last step.  This is the vector E in
C                        the description of the error control.  It is
C                        defined only on a successful return from
C                        DLSODA.  The base address LACOR is obtained by
C                        including in the user's program the
C                        following 2 lines:
C                           COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218), ILS(37)
C                           LACOR = ILS(22)
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 2.  Other Routines Callable.
C
C The following are optional calls which the user may make to
C gain additional capabilities in conjunction with DLSODA.
C (The routines XSETUN and XSETF are designed to conform to the
C SLATEC error handling package.)
C
C     Form of Call                  Function
C   CALL XSETUN(LUN)          set the logical unit number, LUN, for
C                             output of messages from DLSODA, if
C                             the default is not desired.
C                             The default value of LUN is 6.
C
C   CALL XSETF(MFLAG)         set a flag to control the printing of
C                             messages by DLSODA.
C                             MFLAG = 0 means do not print. (Danger:
C                             This risks losing valuable information.)
C                             MFLAG = 1 means print (the default).
C
C                             Either of the above calls may be made at
C                             any time and will take effect immediately.
C
C   CALL DSRCMA(RSAV,ISAV,JOB) saves and restores the contents of
C                             the internal Common blocks used by
C                             DLSODA (see Part 3 below).
C                             RSAV must be a real array of length 240
C                             or more, and ISAV must be an integer
C                             array of length 46 or more.
C                             JOB=1 means save Common into RSAV/ISAV.
C                             JOB=2 means restore Common from RSAV/ISAV.
C                                DSRCMA is useful if one is
C                             interrupting a run and restarting
C                             later, or alternating between two or
C                             more problems solved with DLSODA.
C
C   CALL DINTDY(,,,,,)        provide derivatives of y, of various
C        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
C                             desired.  It may be called only after
C                             a successful return from DLSODA.
C
C The detailed instructions for using DINTDY are as follows.
C The form of the call is:
C
C   CALL DINTDY (T, K, RWORK(21), NYH, DKY, IFLAG)
C
C The input parameters are:
C
C T         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
C             (normally the same as the T last returned by DLSODA).
C             For valid results, T must lie between TCUR - HU and TCUR.
C             (See optional outputs for TCUR and HU.)
C K         = integer order of the derivative desired.  K must satisfy
C             0 .le. K .le. NQCUR, where NQCUR is the current order
C             (see optional outputs).  The capability corresponding
C             to K = 0, i.e. computing y(T), is already provided
C             by DLSODA directly.  Since NQCUR .ge. 1, the first
C             derivative dy/dt is always available with DINTDY.
C RWORK(21) = the base address of the history array YH.
C NYH       = column length of YH, equal to the initial value of NEQ.
C
C The output parameters are:
C
C DKY       = a real array of length NEQ containing the computed value
C             of the K-th derivative of y(t).
C IFLAG     = integer flag, returned as 0 if K and T were legal,
C             -1 if K was illegal, and -2 if T was illegal.
C             On an error return, a message is also written.
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 3.  Common Blocks.
C
C If DLSODA is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
C must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in:
C   (1) the call sequence to DLSODA, and
C   (2) the two internal Common blocks
C         /DLS001/  of length  255  (218 double precision words
C                      followed by 37 integer words),
C         /DLSA01/  of length  31    (22 double precision words
C                      followed by  9 integer words).
C
C If DLSODA is used on a system in which the contents of internal
C Common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
C declare the above Common blocks in the calling program to insure
C that their contents are preserved.
C
C If the solution of a given problem by DLSODA is to be interrupted
C and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
C or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
C following the return from the last DLSODA call prior to the
C interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
C internal Common blocks, and later restore these values before the
C next DLSODA call for that problem.  To save and restore the Common
C blocks, use Subroutine DSRCMA (see Part 2 above).
C
C-----------------------------------------------------------------------
C Part 4.  Optionally Replaceable Solver Routines.
C
C Below is a description of a routine in the DLSODA package which
C relates to the measurement of errors, and can be
C replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  However, since such
C a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
C done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
C (Note: The means by which the package version of a routine is
C superseded by the user's version may be system-dependent.)
C
C (a) DEWSET.
C The following subroutine is called just before each internal
C integration step, and sets the array of error weights, EWT, as
C described under ITOL/RTOL/ATOL above:
C     Subroutine DEWSET (NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, ATOL, YCUR, EWT)
C where NEQ, ITOL, RTOL, and ATOL are as in the DLSODA call sequence,
C YCUR contains the current dependent variable vector, and
C EWT is the array of weights set by DEWSET.
C
C If the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in EWT(i)
C (i = 1,...,NEQ) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
C in y(i) to.  The EWT array returned by DEWSET is passed to the
C DMNORM routine, and also used by DLSODA in the computation
C of the optional output IMXER, and the increments for difference
C quotient Jacobians.
C
C In the user-supplied version of DEWSET, it may be desirable to use
C the current values of derivatives of y.  Derivatives up to order NQ
C are available from the history array YH, described above under
C optional outputs.  In DEWSET, YH is identical to the YCUR array,
C extended to NQ + 1 columns with a column length of NYH and scale
C factors of H**j/factorial(j).  On the first call for the problem,
C given by NST = 0, NQ is 1 and H is temporarily set to 1.0.
C NYH is the initial value of NEQ.  The quantities NQ, H, and NST
C can be obtained by including in DEWSET the statements:
C     DOUBLE PRECISION RLS
C     COMMON /DLS001/ RLS(218),ILS(37)
C     NQ = ILS(33)
C     NST = ILS(34)
C     H = RLS(212)
C Thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
C YCUR(NYH+i)/H  (i=1,...,NEQ)  (and the division by H is
C unnecessary when NST = 0).
