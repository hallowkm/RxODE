We gratefully acknowledge tools, code, bug reports, examples, etc. from
the following individuals. Please do let us know if we've missed anyone.

* Peter N. Brown, Alan C. Hindmarsh, and George D. Byrne for the DVODE
  solver.

* E. Hairer and G. Wanner for the Runge-Kutta ODE solver DOP853.

* Cecilia Magherini and Luigi Brugnano for the previously used (prior
  to RxODE 0.5-1) Fortran BIM code for solving stiff ODEs.

* Linda R. Petzold and Alan C. Hindmarsh for the LSODA solver for stiff
  and non-stiff initial-value first order ODEs.

* C. B. Moler for a couple of LINPACK routines.

* John Bradley Plevyak for DParser (http://dparser.sourceforge.net/).
