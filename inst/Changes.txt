Version 0.5-1

* Mainly changes to prepare for CRAN.

* Added workaround for the Windows issue of folder names with embedded 
  spaces. 

* Cleaned up the ode directory to remove unused fortran code causing
  too many warnings.

* Added a $copy() method to the eventTable object; reversed the default
  time.interval=24 in eventTable$add.dosing().

* Added "tests" subdirectory; more scripts need to be written.

Version 0.5-0

* Moved to github.

Version 0.4-1 

* RxODE objects include get.modelVars() to extract model params, lhs, 
  and state variables

* Update call_dvode.c to prevent aborting R.

Version 0.4-0 (svn revision 123, 06Jan2015)

* Reverted to the simple name "RxODE" from "RxODE2".

* Added syntax to the ODE modeling language to allow comments.

* Deprecated the RxODE function "run", use "solve" going forward.

* Added vignettes and demos.

* Re-named source subdirectories with more descriptive names.

* Changes to RxODE()
    + Added a filename= argument to allow models to be specified via a
      file instead of strings in model= (these two arguments are 
      mutually exclusive);
    + Changed some argument names to better reflect what they are, 
      namely, "th=" in run() now is "params=".  
    + Added a solve() synonym to run() (what about "fit()"?)
    + Re-factor RxODE and moved all the code that deals with 
      parsing, compiling, linking, etc., into a "compilation manager"
      object "cmpMgr".  A new function rx.initCmpMgr() does all this.
    + Fixed bug in run() that was producing "observations" at dosing
      times (i.e., not only at sampling times).
    + Added code in the compilation manager to generate C files
      with project-specific C function names (previously we had a single
      entry for all models); this allows us to working with multiple
      models concurrently.  [We may need to revisit this approach.]

* Changes to eventTable() and its methods:
    + Added optional argument "amount.units=" and "time.units=";
    + add.dosing() no longer has a default dosing.intervals=
      when specifying multiple doses;
    + add.dosing() has a new default for "start.time=" (0 for
      very first dosing event, otherwise max(time) + duration.time.
      [Should we force this not to have a default?]

* C code
    + Renamed jj.c file to tran.c
    + Fixed fprintf() non-constant formats (security warnings on 
      gcc 4.8.2);
    + Fixed non-portable casting from 64-bit pointers to 32-bit ints;
    + ode/dop831.c, deprecated #include <malloc.h> in favor of 
      #include <stdlib.h> (required on Mac OS X);

* Mac OS/X 10.6 
    + Makefile ld(1) requires a space after -o, i.e., "-o tran.exe";

* Windows
    + Updated src/Makefile.win for updated file names, etc.

Version 0.3

* Self-containing: including build parser & libodeaux.a

Version 0.2-1

* Renamed package to RxODE

Version 0.1-1

* Initial version. Depends on external commands tran and 
  prn_tree, plus on external libodeaux.a library.
