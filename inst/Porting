RxODE has been successfully installed on the following environments:

Linux:
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, gcc 4.8.2, gfortran 4.8.2
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.5, Intel icc and ifort 
  version 14.0.1 compilers (compatible with gcc 4.4.7).

Max OS/X:
* MaC OS/X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), R 3.0.2, gcc 4.2.1, gfortran  4.2.3

Windows i386:
* Windows 7, R 3.0.2, Rtools30
* Windows 7, R 3.1.1, Rtools31

Troubleshooting:

* Under Windows, make sure Rtools are properly installed, in particular
  the PATH variable needs to be set properly, e.g., it may need to 
  include the "libexec\gcc\i686-w64-mingw32\<version>" subdirectory, 
  otherwise you may see the error 
    "gcc.exe: error: CreateProcess: No such file or directory"
  when running RxODE().

* Under Windows, make sure the RxODE is installed in a library whose 
  path name contains no spaces -- having spaces in the path name will 
  most likely break calls to "R CMD SHLIB ..." from within the R 
  console/GUI.
