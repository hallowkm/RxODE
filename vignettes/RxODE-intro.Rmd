## RxODE: A tool for performing simulations from 
Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) models, with 
applications for pharmacometrics
***

#### Introduction
`RxODE` is an R package that facilitates simulation with ODE models in
R. It is designed with pharmacometrics models in mind, but can be
applied more generally to any ODE model. Here, a typical
pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PKPD) model is used to illustrate
the application of `RxODE`. This model is illustrated in Figure 1. It is
assumed that all model parameters have been estimated previously.

#### Description of RxODE illustrated through an example
The model equations are specified through a text string in R. Both
differential and algebraic equations are permitted. Differential
equations are specified by `d/dt(var_name) = `. Each
equation is separated by a semicolon.

```{r}
ode <- "
   C2 = centr/V2;
   C3 = peri/V3;
   d/dt(depot) =-KA*depot;
   d/dt(centr) = KA*depot - CL*C2 - Q*C2 + Q*C3;
   d/dt(peri)  =                    Q*C2 - Q*C3;
   d/dt(eff)  = Kin - Kout*(1-C2/(EC50+C2))*eff;
"
```
To load `RxODE` package and compile the model: 
```{r}
library(RxODE)
work <- tempfile("Rx_intro-")
mod1 <- RxODE(model = ode, modName = "mod1", wd = work)
```

Model parameters can be defined as named vectors. Names of parameters in
the vector must be a superset of parameters in the ODE model, and the
order of parameters within the vector is not important. 
```{r}
theta <- 
   c(KA=2.94E-01, CL=1.86E+01, V2=4.02E+01, # central 
     Q=1.05E+01,  V3=2.97E+02,              # peripheral
     Kin=1, Kout=1, EC50=200)               # effects  
```

Initial conditions (ICs) are defined through a vector as well. If the
vector is not named, the number of ICs must equal exactly the number of
ODEs in the model, and the order must be the same as the order in
which the ODEs are listed in the model. 

```{r}
inits <- c(0, 0, 0, 1)    
```

When elements are named, missing elements are added and set to
zero. Also when named, the order of initilizations does not matter.
Therefore the following code is an equvalent initialization as the
code above.


```{r}
inits <- c(eff=1);
```


`RxODE` provides a simple and very flexible way to specify dosing and
sampling through functions that generate an event table. First, an
empty event table is generated through the "eventTable()" function:
```{r}
ev <- eventTable(amount.units='mg', time.units='hours')
```
Next, use the `add.dosing()` and `add.sampling()` functions of the
`EventTable` object to specify the dosing (amounts, frequency and/or
times, etc.) and observation times at which to sample the state of the
system.  These functions can be called multiple times to specify more
complex dosing or sampling regiments.  Here, these functions are used
to specify 10mg BID dosing for 5 days, followed by 20mg QD dosing for
5 days: 
```{r}
ev$add.dosing(dose=10000, nbr.doses=10, dosing.interval=12)
ev$add.dosing(dose=20000, nbr.doses=5, start.time=120, dosing.interval=24)
ev$add.sampling(0:240)
```

The functions `get.dosing()` and `get.sampling()` can be used to
retrieve information from the event table.  

```{r}
head(ev$get.dosing())
```

```{r}
head(ev$get.sampling())
```

The simulation can now be run by calling the model object's run
function. Simulation results for all variables in the model are stored
in the output matrix x. 

```{r}
x <- mod1$solve(theta, ev, inits)
head(x)
```

This can also be solved by the `predict()` method:

```{r}
x <- predict(mod1,theta, ev, inits)
head(x)
```


```{r fig.width=10}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
matplot(x[,"C2"], type="l", ylab="Central Concentration")
matplot(x[,"eff"], type="l", ylab = "Effect")
```

#### Simulation of Variability with RxODE
Variability in model parameters can be simulated by creating a matrix
of parameter values for use in the simulation. In the example below,
40% variability in clearance is simulated. 

```{r}
nsub <- 100						  #number of subproblems
CL <- 1.86E+01*exp(rnorm(nsub,0,.4^2))
theta.all <- 
	cbind(KA=2.94E-01, CL=CL, V2=4.02E+01,  # central 
	Q=1.05E+01, V3=2.97E+02,                # peripheral
	Kin=1, Kout=1, EC50=200)                # effects  
head(theta.all)
```

Each subproblem can be simulated by using an explicit loop (or the `apply()`
function) to run the simulation for each set of parameters of in the parameter
matrix. 

```{r fig.width=10}
nobs <- ev$get.nobs()
cp.all <- matrix(NA, nobs, nsub)
for (i in 1:nsub)
{
	theta <- theta.all[i,]
	x <- mod1$solve(theta, ev, inits=inits)
	cp.all[, i] <- x[, "C2"]
}

matplot(cp.all, type="l", ylab="Central Concentration")

```

It is now straightforward to perform calculations and generate plots
with the simulated data. Below,  the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles
of the simulated data are plotted. 

```{r fig.width=10}
cp.q <- apply(cp.all, 1, quantile, prob = c(0.05, 0.50, 0.95))
matplot(t(cp.q), type="l", lty=c(2,1,2), col=c(2,1,2), ylab="Central Concentration")

```

#### Facilities for generating R shiny applications

An example of creating an R [shiny application](http://shiny.rstudio.com) to
interactively explore responses of various complex dosing regimens is available
at http://qsp.engr.uga.edu:3838/RxODE/RegimenSimulator.  Shiny applications
like this one may be programmatically created with the experimental function
`genShinyApp.template()`.

The above application includes widgets for varying the dose, dosing
regimen, dose cycle, and number of cycles.  

```

genShinyApp.template(appDir = "shinyExample", verbose=TRUE)

library(shiny)
runApp("shinyExample")

```
